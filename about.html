	About CADA</h1>
<br />
The Cheer &amp; Dance Academy was started in 2010 by two sisters wanting to give kids &amp; adults, boys &amp; girls the opportunity to learn, advance &amp; perform different dance styles in a confidence buliding, fun safe environment.<br />
<br />
<strong>INSTRUCTORS/COACHES</strong><br />
At CADA we are very blessed to have the support of many experienced &amp; qualified Instructors &amp; All Star Cheerleading Coaches. All our coaches are credited by the IASF &amp; USASF Cheerleading bodies and are associated with AASCF. All CADA Instructors have acquired Fitness Leader Certificates and have many years of experience in the fields of dance with completing the highest level of grading. They are also qualified in first aid, CPR and are blue card register. Introducing the CADA Staff:&nbsp;<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>CLASSES</strong><br />
CADA offers Jazz, Hip Hop, Cheerleading(including stunts, tumbling &amp; pom motions)&nbsp;&amp; Freestyle&nbsp;classes to both boys &amp; girls&nbsp;from 3 years &amp; up.<br />
The break down of classes by age as follows:<br />
Mini (3-7yrs), Junior (8-12yrs) &amp; Senior (13yrs &amp; up). We also provide Advanced &amp; Competition Team classes (an audition is required for these classes).<br />
All 2012 class times &amp; locations please view our Schedules page.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>DISPLAYS, PERFORMANCES &amp;&nbsp;CONCERTS</strong><br />
All CADA students are invited to participate in various performances throughout the year. Taking part in performances is not compulsory but if your child loves to&nbsp;dress&nbsp;up in cool costumes &amp; puts on mini concerts for you at home, I would highly recommend the rewarding fulfillment of performing at displays&nbsp;&amp; concerts. Performances are heaps of fun, help build confidence &amp; performance skills such as showmanship &amp; presentation. All&nbsp;members that wish to perform require 2012 CADA costume, CADA approved dance/cheer shoes, hair &amp; make up and a pocket full of smiles. Every effort is made to design bright and beautiful costumes at a very reasonable cost and are available for order in March &amp; June from your studio receptionist (costume cost from $80).&nbsp;CADA students have the opportunity to perform in many local school fetes, shopping centers, CADA Carnival, charity&nbsp;&amp; themed concerts throughout the year (to read more please view your studio newsletter).<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>GRADING</strong><br />
Grading is a rewarding optional event for members to participate in every year.&nbsp;Students perform their routines as a group before two judges and those who participate receive a report card, certificate of achievement&nbsp;&amp; trophy awarded to them on stage at the&nbsp;last concert at the end of the year. A grading fee applies (approx.$30 per class) and students are required to wear the CADA uniform.<br />
